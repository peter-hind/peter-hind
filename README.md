 <h2>About me üëπ</h2>
  </summary>

<p>I've loved tech since I was a little kid. My Mum was a software developer in the eighties, which a was a REAL different time. ChatGPT wasn't a thing. Hell, the INTERNET wasn't a thing. I remember watching her slaving away at her AS-400 terminal, the green glow spilling over a veritable mountain of coding books left strewn around the place. When I could just about read I picked up a book on Java (or was it C? doesn't matter), and got almost a chapter through it, which was apparently showing enough interest to warrant getting me a BBC Microcomputer for my seventh birthday. I wrote a few programs in BASIC - including a little game with a Dragon (two white boxes on top of each other) in a maze. If you hit the walls it was Game Over (the program crashed because I couldn't figure the rest out).</p>
<p>I wish I'd kept coding throughout my teens, but I didn't. There was other stuff happening. You know the story - PlayStations and Girls and things. Nevertheless, I always kept an attachment to tech. When my Aikido Club needed a website, I made it. When friends didn't understand techy stuff, I was that guy they came to (you know that Guy! Wait, this is GitHub, you probably ARE that Guy. Or girl, obviously). 
In pretty much every job I had in my teens and twenties, somebody at some point would say something like:
"...why aren't you working in Tech?", or, if I'd just solved a problem or written them a little script, a confused "....why do you work HERE?" was also commonplace. I would just shrug. Because I dont have a CompSci degree, I would think. I had chosen to study people-languages at University rather than machine-languages, which were another passion of mine.</p>
<p>The turning point in my career came after I took it upon myself to build a little App. I was working as a Sales Rep / Tech Specialist / Marketing Guru / OHS Administrator / Staff Onboarder (otherwise known as an 'allrounder') at a company in Melbourne. It was in that post-COVID lull a lot of businesses experienced, so I was looking for ways to improve processes. So I built this App. I won't bore you with what it did, but I enjoyed myself building it more than I had enjoyed myself in a looooong time! My manager loved it. The he hit me with 'the line':</p>
<p>"....why don't you work in Tech?"</p>
<p>For once, I actually listened. My partner and I had just made the decision to relocate to New Zealand permanently, so now seemed like a prime opportunity. I enrolled at DevAcademy Aotearoa and spent four months and close to 1000 hours wading through tech. I loved it. Solo projects. Group projects. Stuff that didn't work. That feeling when I MADE it work.</p>
<p>So now I'm a developer, soaking up as much knowledge and info as I can. I'm a firm supporter of Web3 and Blockchain tech, and am eager to see more adoption here in NZ! Lets go!</p>

  <p>Lots of these repos were cloned / worked on as part of my intensive study while learning at DevAcademy Aotearoa. Most were completed under time-constraints and were there to facilitate my learning. Feel free to take a look around and check out my learning process, and please DO check out the pinned repos and currently deployed projects.</p>
  <p>I'm always open to any form of feedback, so please don't be a stranger and hit me up at any of the endpoints listed above if you feel like a chat!</p>
